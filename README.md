# nmap-script
This nmap script will scan for open ports, OS and services of a target (IP or web address). The OS and Services report will be automatically exported to a .txt file and will not display on the screen. The .txt file location will need to be updated in the script based on where you would like it to go. The script will then open an instance of metasploit.

*****UPDATED*****
The newly revised script now adds searchsploit as an option
